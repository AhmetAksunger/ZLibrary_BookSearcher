# ZLibrary_BookSearcher
ZLibrary Book Searcher
This is a simple Python program that uses the Selenium WebDriver to search for books on ZLibrary and display a list of the top 10 results.
The user can access the link of the book by entering its index.

To use the program, simply run "python book_searcher.py" on your terminal.


**Note**: Don't forget to change the email and password fields in the code to your own information before running the program.

Here are some screenshots of the program.
